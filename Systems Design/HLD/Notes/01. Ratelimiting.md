# Rate Limiter

Rate limiting is a technique used in computer systems to control the rate at which requests are sent or processed in order to maintain system stability and security

By limiting the number of requests, companies can protect against various types of attacks, such as below

`DDoS attacks:` By restricting the number of requests to a reasonable level, organizations can prevent DDoS attacks from overloading their system and bringing it down.

`Credential stuffing:` Limiting login attempts from a single IP address or user can prevent credential stuffing attacks, where attackers use automated scripts to try different combinations of usernames and passwords until they find a good match.

`Brute force attacks:` Limiting the number of requests or attempts to access a resource can help prevent brute force attacks, where attackers try different combinations of characters to gain access to a system or application.

`Data scraping:` Rate limiting can help prevent data scraping by restricting the number of requests made by a single user or IP address. Attackers are prevented from scraping sensitive data.

`Inventory hoarding attacks:` Limiting the number of requests for a particular item or resource can thwart inventory hoarding attacks, where attackers try to purchase all available inventory of a popular item to resell at a higher price.

# Algorithms used for rate limiting

Rate-limiting algorithms are essential tools that enable organizations to control and limit the rate of incoming requests to their applications and systems. Different algorithms can be used depending on the specific needs of the application or system.

`Fixed-window rate limiting:` This is a straightforward algorithm that counts the number of requests received within a fixed time window, such as one minute. Once the maximum number of requests is reached, additional requests are rejected until the next window begins. This algorithm is easy to implement and effective against DDoS attacks but may limit legitimate users.

## Disadvantages

- It is possible to experience spikes near the edges of the window, since APIs users might program their requests in a "use or lose it" approach.

- One way to minimize the spikiness in this scheme is to have multiple time windows of different granularity. 
- For example, you can rate limit at the hour and minute levels, say, allowing a maximum of 2,000 request per hour, and a maximum of 33 requests per minute.

`Sliding-window rate limiting:` This algorithm tracks the number of requests received in the recent past using a sliding window that moves over time. This algorithm is more flexible than fixed-window rate limiting and can adjust to spikes in traffic, making it a better choice for applications with varying usage patterns. However, it may not be as effective against sustained attacks.

`Token bucket rate limiting:` This maintains a token bucket that is refilled at a fixed rate. Each request consumes a token, and additional requests are denied once the bucket is empty. Token bucket rate limiting is suitable for handling bursts of traffic, as it can allow a certain number of requests to be processed simultaneously. However, it may not be as effective against sustained traffic.

`Leaky bucket rate limiting:` Similar to token bucket rate limiting but puts requests into a “bucket” that gradually empties over time, allowing more requests to be processed. This algorithm is effective against bursts of traffic and helps to prevent overload, but it may not be as effective against sustained attacks.
